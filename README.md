# Model exploration
This repository contains code for exploring various anomaly detection models as well as testing and comparing their performance on realistic data sets. 

For each new model to explore, we add a new jupyter notebook in the notebooks/ folder. This allows to interactively make plots and quickly get a feel for a model. Helper code can be place in .py files in the src/ folder. 

The data/ folder is added to the .gitignore and will thus not be pushed to the remote repo on Github.
